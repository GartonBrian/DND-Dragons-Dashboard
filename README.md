Dungeons & Dragons Dragons Analysis: A Tableau Adventure
Welcome to my Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) Tableau project! This dashboard is designed to take anyone—whether you’re a seasoned dungeon master or have never heard of D&D—on a journey through one of the most iconic elements of the game: dragons.

Project Overview
Everyone knows that Dungeons & Dragons has dragons, but how many are there really? I wanted to answer this question and take it a step further—breaking down dragons in the game based on their size, stats, and how they stack up against other creatures in the D&D universe.

However, getting data directly from D&D’s parent company is a bit tricky—they guard their intellectual property closely. Luckily, someone on Kaggle had already scraped and shared the data, so I used that to dive into my analysis.

This project is part of my effort to hone my data manipulation and visualization skills, using Tableau to create a story from complex data and communicate it in a way that's fun and easy to understand.

What You’ll Find in the Dashboard
1. How Many Dragons Are in D&D?
I start off with a look at how dragons compare to other monster types in D&D. Believe it or not, the number of dragon types in the game is on par with the number of ordinary animals (like bears and wolves). That’s wild, right? You’d think dragons would be rarer, but there’s a whole bunch of them waiting to be encountered in your next campaign!

2. Dragons by Health Points (HP) and Armor Class (AC)
The second part of the presentation explores how difficult it is to face different creatures based on their HP (health points) and AC (armor class). These are the two key stats that determine how tough a monster is. The larger the circle in the graph, the bigger the creature, with dragons being some of the largest. For context: a human-sized creature is medium, but a dragon can be as big as an aircraft carrier (gargantuan)!

3. Dragon Stats by Color and Age
In this section, I narrow the focus to dragons themselves. As dragons age, they not only get more powerful, they also get larger and more terrifying. The graph highlights different dragon types, organized by their color or metallic properties, and shows how their stats change with age.

4. Talking Your Way Out of a Dragon Fight
Dragons are tough. But let’s face it: fighting one is a last resort. So, what if you could talk your way out of a dragon encounter? The next graph focuses on two key stats—wisdom and charisma—to determine how likely a dragon is to be fooled by a clever lie, or conversely, how likely it is to deceive you.

Wisdom: A lower wisdom score means the dragon is more likely to believe a lie you tell it.
Charisma: A higher charisma score means the dragon is more likely to persuade or deceive you with its own lies.
This final visualization shows how different types of dragons measure up in terms of wisdom and charisma, giving you insight into which dragons might be better to avoid altogether—or at least try talking your way out of trouble with!

Takeaways
This Tableau dashboard demonstrates my ability to:

Manipulate complex datasets (even when the source data isn’t perfect).
Create engaging data visualizations that tell a story.
Communicate intricate or niche concepts (like D&D stats!) to a broader audience in a way that’s easy to digest.
While this project is based on something as fun as dragons in D&D, the core skills—data analysis, storytelling, and visualization—are what I’m excited to apply to real-world data and projects.
